S3: Ideall structure
S3: Fuse with dotplot from S4
newS4: Zoomout in S4.2
S5: Zoomin cut from x axis to 0-200
S5: Y axis label update , increase shape figure
S5: Replace scatter with 3 boxplot bins of ranges 0-50 50-100 100-200
S6: Split to Insert and skip
S5&7: Two plots for different basepairs center and end stems
S8: Add new slide of the third experiment with only end stem insert case
Move S12 after S8 and make a table out of it only with number with a.b.c formula
S11: Remove
S9 is not needed, remove it
Color cis-reg box plots

Conclusion: Observation and partial 
One should be aware/skeptic of large/assymetric multi-loops in prediction [Cite/quote to turner paper]
Multiloop scoring is only for efficiency reasons there
This observation concerns the long range basepair interaction problem
If using local folding [W150, L100] this observation
